# World_Weather_Analysis

When I finished the WeatherPy part of the assignment and began on the VacationPy part I had trouble reading in the CSV from the previous part. I eventually realized it was because in the WeatherPy part of the assignment, I had sent the CSV to the folder one level above from where I was attempting to read the file from. I ended up just copying the output folder and moving it to the starter_code folder and then it ran just fine.
